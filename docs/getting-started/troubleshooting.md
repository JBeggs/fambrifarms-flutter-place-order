# Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### System Status Issues

#### "Feature Not Working as Expected"
**Issue**: Some documented features may not work exactly as described
**Solution**: 
- Check the [Implementation Status](../../README.md#-implementation-status) section
- Features marked as "üîÑ Partially Implemented" may need additional configuration
- Report specific issues with detailed steps to reproduce

#### "WhatsApp Integration Inconsistent"
**Issue**: WhatsApp scraping works sometimes but fails other times
**Solution**:
- WhatsApp Web interface changes can affect scraping
- Try restarting the Python server: `python main.py`
- Clear Chrome session: Delete `whatsapp-session/` folder and re-authenticate
- Check Chrome version compatibility

### Development & Testing Issues

#### "Testing Documentation Doesn't Match Code"
**Issue**: Some test specifications reference missing components
**Solution**:
- Focus on testing implemented features first
- Use the actual code in `python/app/core/whatsapp_crawler.py` as reference
- Test basic message scraping before advanced features

#### "Pricing System Not Responding"
**Issue**: Intelligent pricing features show errors
**Solution**:
- UI is complete but backend integration is being validated
- Use basic product management features while pricing system is refined
- Check Django backend logs for specific errors

## üö® Quick Diagnostics

### System Health Check
```bash
# 1. Check Python server
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health

# 2. Check Django backend  
curl http://localhost:8000/api/whatsapp/health/

# 3. Check Flutter app
flutter doctor -v
```

### Log Locations
- **Python Server**: Console output with `[PY]` prefix
- **Flutter App**: Debug console with `[DJANGO]` and `[WHATSAPP]` prefixes
- **Django Backend**: `backend/django_logs` file
- **Chrome Debug**: `python/whatsapp-session/chrome_debug.log`

# Linux (desktop) ‚Ä¢ linux ‚Ä¢ linux-x64
```

## üì± WhatsApp Integration Issues

### QR Code Problems

**Issue**: QR code not appearing
```bash
# Check Chrome browser opens
# Verify WhatsApp Web loads: https://web.whatsapp.com
# Clear Chrome cache and cookies for WhatsApp Web
# Try incognito mode
```

**Issue**: QR code expired
```bash
# Delete session data
rm -rf python/whatsapp-session/

# Restart Python server
python python/whatsapp_server.py

# Scan new QR code
```

### Group Selection Issues

**Issue**: Target group not found
```bash
# Verify group name exactly matches
echo $TARGET_GROUP_NAME

# Check you have access to the group
# Verify group exists and has recent messages
# Try manual search in WhatsApp Web
```

**Issue**: Group selected but no messages
```bash
# Check group has recent messages
# Verify you have permission to view messages
# Try scrolling up in WhatsApp Web to load more messages
# Check if group is archived or muted
```

### Message Scraping Problems

```bash
# Check WhatsApp Web interface loaded properly
# Verify group is selected (header shows group name)
# Check for JavaScript errors in Chrome console (F12)
# Try refreshing WhatsApp Web page
```

**Issue**: Messages appear but content is empty
```bash
# WhatsApp Web selectors may have changed
# Check Chrome console for errors
# Verify messages are visible in WhatsApp Web
# Try different message types (text vs media)
```

## üîó API Connection Issues

### Django Backend Connection

**Error**: `Connection refused to localhost:8000`
```bash
# Verify Django server is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/whatsapp/health/

# Start Django server if needed
cd backend/
python manage.py runserver

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8000
```

**Error**: `CORS errors in Flutter app`
```bash
# Verify django-cors-headers is installed

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Flutter web
]
```

### Python Server Connection

**Error**: `Failed to connect to Python server`
```bash
# Verify Python server is running
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health

# Check Flutter API service configuration
# Verify baseUrl in lib/services/api_service.dart:
# static const String whatsappBaseUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/api';
```

## üîß Performance Issues

### Slow Message Scraping

**Symptoms**: Scraping takes >30 seconds
```bash
# Reduce message load by scrolling less
# Check Chrome memory usage
# Close other Chrome tabs
# Restart Chrome browser
# Check internet connection speed
```

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: System becomes slow, >1GB RAM usage
```bash
# Restart Python server periodically
# Close unused Chrome tabs
# Monitor Chrome processes:
ps aux | grep chrome  # macOS/Linux
tasklist | findstr chrome  # Windows

# Kill excess Chrome processes if needed
```

### Flutter App Lag

**Symptoms**: UI becomes unresponsive
```bash
# Run in release mode for better performance
flutter run --release -d windows

# Check for memory leaks in debug console
# Reduce message list size
# Restart Flutter app
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Enable Debug Logging

**Python Server**:
```python
# In whatsapp_server.py, add:
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

**Flutter App**:
```dart
// In main.dart, add:
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

void main() {
  if (kDebugMode) {
    print('Debug mode enabled');
  }
  // ... rest of main
}
```

### Chrome DevTools

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) while WhatsApp Web is open
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Use Elements tab to inspect WhatsApp Web structure

### API Testing

```bash
# Test Python server endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/whatsapp/start
curl http://localhost:5001/api/messages
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health

# Test Django backend endpoints  
curl http://localhost:8000/api/whatsapp/messages/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/whatsapp/health/
```
